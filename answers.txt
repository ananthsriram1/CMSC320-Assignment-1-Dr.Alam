Data science can be applied to healthcare. For example, it helps predict patient outcomes by analyzing 
medical records and genetic data, leading to personalized treatment plans and improved patient care.

I hope to improve my data analysis skills, gain a deeper understanding of 
machine learning algorithms, and enhance my proficiency in programming languages like 
Python and R for data science applications.
